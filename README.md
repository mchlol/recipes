# WORK IN PROGRESS
A small collection of recipes rewritten in a way that makes it easier for me to follow.

## About this project

I built this to practice some design along with what I learned in the beginning of the Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp. It has a similar structure to the portfolio project - nav bar, sections, footer. Nothing fancy. Actually it looks a bit shit. Designer I am not. My next challenge is going to be to overhaul the design, get rid of the clutter, and make it make more sense in the context of a recipe viewer (not a recipe site - this will only ever be one page).  
  

New recipes will be added whenever I feel like it. Right now I like the Sausage Hotpot a lot.
