WORK IN PROGRESS
<br>
A small collection of recipes rewritten in a way that makes it easier for me to follow. <br>

<strong>About this project</strong>
I built this to practice some design along with what I learned in the beginning of the Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp. It has a similar structure to the portfolio project - nav bar, sections, footer. Nothing fancy.<br>
I chose this because I like a recipe to include the prep in the steps (e.g. chop the onion, cook rice for n mins, etc) and a lot of recipes don't do that. So I created a little page for recipes I use a lot with steps that make sense to me.<br>
In time I'd like to refine this by using JavaScript to show one recipe at a time, rather than all in a row.<br>
For now you can use the nav bar at the top of the page to take you back to the list of recipes.<br>
New recipes will be added whenever I feel like it. Right now I like the Sausage Hotpot a lot.<br>

Here's something else I learned incidentally - deleting a git branch locally. I should have been doing this through the command line, but I just deleted a branch on github. Of course all my branches were still there locally. Using the command <em>git branch -d <branch></em> clears up that clutter.
