# WORK IN PROGRESS
A small collection of recipes rewritten in a way that makes it easier for me to follow.<br>

<h2>About this project</h2>
I built this to practice some design along with what I learned in the beginning of the Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp. It has a similar structure to the portfolio project - nav bar, sections, footer. Nothing fancy.<br>
I chose this because I like a recipe to include the prep in the steps (e.g. chop the onion, cook rice for n mins, etc) and a lot of recipes don't do that. So I created a little page for recipes I use a lot with steps that make sense to me.<br>
In time I'd like to refine this by using JavaScript to show one recipe at a time, rather than all in a row.
For now you can use the nav bar at the top of the page to take you back to the list of recipes.<br>
New recipes will be added whenever I feel like it. Right now I like the Sausage Hotpot a lot.<br>
